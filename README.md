Systems Prog first assignment using C programming and the -zsh terminal

C Programming Project: 🛸Greetings

This repository contains a basic C program that demonstrates function creation, organization with headers, and compilation using a makefile. The program consists of three core components:

hello.c: Prints "Hello World!" 🌎
bye.c: Prints "Goodbye World!"👋🏾
main.c: Calls the two functions in sequence
main.h: Header file with function declarations
Makefile: Automates the compilation process into an executable named greetings


🛠️ Compiled and ran on a UNIX 🍎MacOS system. I used my -zsh terminal
